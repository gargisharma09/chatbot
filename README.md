Chatbot in C
This repository contains a simple rule-based chatbot built using the C programming language. The project demonstrates how basic string handling, conditional logic, and user-defined
functions can be combined to simulate conversational responses.

Features

Text-based interaction in the terminal
Rule-based response system
Modular C code using functions
Easy to extend with new responses

How It Works
The chatbot reads user input, matches it with predefined patterns, and returns an appropriate response. The conversation continues until the exit command is given.

Requirements
GCC or any C compiler
Windows/Linux terminal
Running the Program
gcc chatbot.c -o chatbot
./chatbot

Project Structure
chatbot.c – main source file
responses.h / responses.c – optional modules for organizing responses

Future Improvements
Add NLP-based matching
Improve context handling
Integrate file-based logging
